Write macro definitions with arguments for calculation of Simple Interest and Amount. Store these macro definitions in a file called “interest.h”. Include this file in your program, and use the macro definitions for calculating simple interest and amount.
#define INTEREST(p, n, r) ((p * n * r) / 100)
#define AMOUNT(p, si) (p + si)
